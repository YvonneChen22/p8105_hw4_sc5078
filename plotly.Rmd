We are going to look at "The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017", we are only interested in items ordered in produce department on weekends.

```{r data import and clean}
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart |> 
  select(add_to_cart_order, reordered, order_number, department, aisle, days_since_prior_order, product_name, order_dow) |>
  filter(department %in% "produce") |>
  filter(order_dow %in% c("0", "6"))
```

The plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.
```{r}
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~aisle, y = ~n, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, alpha = 0.5)
  
```
